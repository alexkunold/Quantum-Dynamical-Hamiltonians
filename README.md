# Quantum-Dynamical-Hamiltonians
Calculates the quantum time evolution operator for dynamical Hamiltonians
## Abstract
Calculating the time evolution operator of a given Hamiltonian can be tough.
These programs enable to calculate the time evolution operator of dynamical
Hamiltonians, i.e., Hamiltonians that are the linear combination of the
elements of a finite dimensional Lie algegra.
